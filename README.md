# Pokedex created for Zappts recruitment process

A simple web application developed in ReactJS of a pokedex using PokeAPI.

## Stack

**Front-end:** React, SASS, React Router, Axios.


## Functionalities

- Navbar for easy navigation
- Search bar for specific pokémon information
- Cards with pokemon informations in order of realease


## Development

I stared a lot of challenges during the development. At first it looks a really simples and easy job to do, but deal with all the information that we get from an API and stylize them are a real challenge. 

I started by creating the Navbar. That out of the way I could develop all my routes, making my application faster and easier to maintain.
At this point it was time to get all the API information that I needed to display, print it on the screen and stylize everything.

With the time given this result was the best that I could achieve, but I won't stop here.
I had a lot of fun developing this application and I'm not satisfied with the current result. 

I could't stylize the info that we get by the search bar. The pokémons cards have some different sizes. The button mouse hover is acting weird right now, he's incresing the button size.









## Improvements

I already listed the major problems that I had during the development. The next steps will be those topics improvements.

- Create a card for pokémon data received by search bar

- Stylize the search bar and button

- Add a category filter

- Increase the cards appearance
